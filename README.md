# Convert and Merge PDF files

This program converts and merges files from the desired directory into a single pdf file.

**NOTE: the converting functionality does not currently exist, but will be added in the future.**

## Functionality

- run: `python main.py [merged_filename]`

- When prompted, input the desired directory you would like to merge into a single file.

- File is saved to the working directory.

## TODO:
    - Add file conversion so images become pdfs
    - Move merged files to a 'to_be_deleted' directory leaving behind only `the merged pdf file
